# Mock-Banking-App
This is a simple, Mock Banking Application. Built with Core Java principles and Swing GUI elements, you have access to various features such as opening accounts, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds. A full list of features can be found below. This project solidified my understanding of Core Java, Object Oriented Programming, and Swing GUI design. I am excited to continue improving it!
